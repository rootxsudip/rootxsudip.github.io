      <description>Before diving into prototype pollution we need to learn about javascript objects and prototype basics.&#xA;What is a javascript object? An object in a non-primitive data type which represents a collection of key value pairs. It is to used to store and organize data in a structure manner.&#xA;Example code:&#xA;//Object let car = { name: &amp;#34;audi&amp;#34;, model: &amp;#34;r8&amp;#34;, engine: &amp;#34;V10&amp;#34; } //Accessing object properties console.log(car.name) console.log(car.model) Constructor: Constructor functions are functions used as blueprints for creating multiple instances of objects with similar properties and methods.</description>

      <description>Hello guys, here is the 2nd part of blog. This is the most critical bug i have ever found in TryHackMe, using this bug an attacker can edit and delete any rooms of THM.&#xA;I uploaded the POC video to Youtube.&#xA;Shortest Bug Explanation: Any room is edited through a parameter with a room name, i created two room with two different accounts. While deleting/editing the 1st room name i intercepted the request and change the 1st room to 2nd room name, it throwed 403.</description>

      <description>Hello guys, during my hunting i find two vulnerabilities in THM, today i will talk about the first vuln which is S3 Bucket misconfiguration.&#xA;If you donâ€™t know what is s3 bucket and how it leads to vulns check the references.&#xA;1. S3 Bucket Misconfiguation Leads to deletion of any images(profile,room images,banner etc..) When, uploading my profile pic, i saw it was uploaded to a s3 bucket.&#xA;My first thought was can i perform read, upload and delete operation in the S3 bucket?</description>

      <description>Hello, amazing hackers my name is Sudip Roy and i am an InfoSec student and part-time Bug Hunter.This is my first writeup about a critical vulnerability which i found on a website(Vdp). Hope you guys will like it and learn something new from it.&#xA;Lets get started, The website provides cloud-based consumer identity and access management (CIAM) solution. For testing purposes i signup using my account, select developer pro(extra features), created a app and looked for every features of the website, 1 hour later i decided to play with the delete account feature from the settings page.</description>
